# A Review of Generalization Bounds in Neural Networkss
The goal of this research report was to prove tighter generalization bounds through different approaches: compression-based framework, univariate Lipschitz functions and over-parametrization. Each with their own tight bound on generalization error and drawbacks to the approach.
